# FileUploadSpringBoot
Th FileUploadSpringBoot is a file uploading api which is developed using Spring boot, Spring Data Jpa and Hibernate
I implemented it as a RESTful service using the Spring Web MVC.
It Uses MySQL database to store the file meta data
The uploaded files are stored in a directory called "uploads" in the root

Run "FileUploadConfiguration" to start the server and call the REST services
